                <p class="projectDescrip__body">Thermometrik is designed to assist users in creating high-quality coffee
                    by being compatible with manual brewing methods. As it can dispense various volumes of water, our
                    product assists those who want to brew single-servings as well as brewing for larger groups. While
                    some users enjoy their coffee brewing ritual and others simply want the end product, all users
                    expressed interest in speeding up the preparation process. Thermometrik lowers usersâ€™ involvement in
                    the preparation process by delivering hot water instantly while providing the precise temperature
                    control that high-quality coffee desires.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Overview</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">The goal for my senior capstone was to design a high-fidelity prototype that
                    solved a problem users experience on a regular basis. This problem was one that had an open area in
                    the market with no current solutions. Our team determined this need on our own, but we had to ensure
                    our final prototype was designed for manufacturability and had a viable commercialization strategy.
                </p>
                <p class="subsection__body">We determined that there was a gap in the market for products that addressed
                    preparing high-quality coffee while having low involvement in the process.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Defining Our Problem Space</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">To define what part of the coffee-making process we were looking to solve or
                    improve, I performed zoom interviews; created, disseminated, and analyzed Qualtrics surveys; and
                    analyzed social media platforms to determine coffee trends. We found that all users expressed
                    interest in speeding up the preparation process. In addition, our desire to create a product that
                    could be used for all manual brewing further affirmed this direction. </p>
                <p class="subsection__body">With this in mind, we created a function tree, which helped us understand
                    places in the process we could improve and what technical barriers we had to work around. We also
                    created user personas, which defined our key users and what their wants and desires from a product
                    would be. These, pictured below, helped us better understand the scope of our problem. </p>

                <p class="subsection__body">We used those to brainstorm multiple mockups that addressed limiting
                    wait
                    time for heating water and ensuring consistency in the final product for users. The concepts we
                    focused on testing included fast delivery of hot water, convenient bean dispensing, and
                    improving
                    the hot water pouring experience.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">User Testing</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we had the concepts that we wanted to test, we built mockups and
                    performed user testing in person. Despite being socially distanced, we were able to receive
                    valuable
                    feedback through having users interact with a baseline coffee setup and then our mockups at a
                    different station. After brewing a cup of coffee they were asked to quantitatively rate the
                    features
                    of the stations as well as qualitatively share their thoughts on the experience.</p>
                <p class="subsection__body">An analysis of our results determined that the hot water direction was
                    the
                    most promising and interesting to users because of the overall positive reaction to the time
                    saved.
                    Additionally, a hot water solution was a product that users could actually see themselves
                    implementing in their home, unlike the other mockups which received positive feedback for their
                    novelty, but many stated they would never realistically buy. I took this information and
                    performed a
                    thorough patent analysis, which involved looking at 29 relevant patents and going through their
                    documentation history in order to determine points of differentiation.</p>

            <p class="subsection__body">We started out by creating a basic works-like prototype to see if we could
                prove
                functionality. Multiple rounds of testing and mockups led us to our final prototype, which was able
                to
                meet all of our marginal requirements and some of our desired requirements. This included having the
                body of water in the reservoir uniformly within two degrees and the water temperature output within
                two
                degrees of the desired temperature.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">DFA + DFM Considerations</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">To envision what we wanted our final product to look like we took to
                Solidworks.
                I assisted in tolerancing the casing components to ensure manufacturability. In addition to ensuring
                tolerances were reasonable, we also met with our professors and manufacturers to discuss the
                feasibility
                of actual production. We were able to iterate on their feedback, especially relating to the joins
                between components, and use that to reach our final design.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">Looks-Like Prototype</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">Due to COVID restrictions, we were not able to get the necessary parts
                shipped
                in time to create a works-like looks-like prototype. However, we were able to 3D print the shell in
                order to see the scale and how the casing components would assemble.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h2 class="subsection__title">Direct to Consumer Route</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">We determined that the best commercialization route for the Thermometrik would
                be to start on Kickstarter, expand to offerings on Shopify and Amazon and eventually sell directly to
                consumers through our own website. This was the best route due to the fact that common competitors in
                the market, such as Fellow, found success through a similar route. This would also allow for higher
                margins and allow us to have a direct line to consumers for insights, which was something that we highly
                valued and wanted to have at the forefront of our brand. Even though this route would be more
                logistically challenging than other options, we believed the promise and possibilities after examining
                our prospective business model canvas outweighed the potential downsides.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">Marketing Plan</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">Our strategy for marketing was focused heavily on social media marketing as it
                aligned with our plans to launch through Kickstarter. We also included SEO and site content because a
                large portion of our target audience are coffee drinkers that meticulously research the topic. We wanted
                our brand to evoke the following in relation to our products: Precision, High-End, Minimal, Convenient,
                Modern. This led me to design the following color palette to be reflected in all marketing materials of
                black, white, and blue. The black and white emphasizes precision, minimalism, high-end, and modern
                sentiments, while the blue ties our focus back to water. </p>

                Throughout this project, I broadened my team management skills, completed extensive user research, and
                gained engineering skills through technical testing. I also learned about the intricacies of designing a
                product for manufacturing and assembly and gained insight from suppliers to the creation of molds.</p>
