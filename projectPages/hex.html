                <h3 class="project__title">HEXAPLANTER</h3>
                <p class="project__descrip">is a raised planter bed that grants better access to older people, when watering and tending to plants, because it provides multiple heights of plant beds that can be worked on without the user having to bend over. The lazy susan paired with the handles that go around the entire planter allow for easy turning and accessibility to all sides of the hexagon. The planter can be indoors during winter and outdoors during summer making the planter accessible year round. The large wheels make it easy to move the planter in the uneven outdoor surfaces of Westwood and have locks for safety. The planter is also painted with bright, fun colors to help bring cheer to the residentsâ€™ lives. This project was created for Design Thinking and Communication, a 10-week engineering course at Northwestern University.</p>
