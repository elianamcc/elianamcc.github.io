                <p class="projectDescrip__body">Designed for the residents of an elderly home that partners with Let’s
                    Go Chicago, the HexaPlanter improves garden accessibility through a couple of key features. The
                    various plant bed heights allow the user to work without having to bend over. The lazy susan paired
                    with the handles that go around the entire planter allow for easy turning and accessibility to all
                    sides of the hexagon. It has large wheels, which makes it easy to move over uneven outdoor surfaces
                    and allows the planter to be used both indoors and outdoors- making the planter accessible
                    year-round.

                <p class="subsection__body">We were tasked with finding a garden solution for our client, however the
                    client pointed out many potential problem areas for us to look into. To decide which problem area we
                    wanted to focus on our team went through a design elimination process. After sketching and
                    brainstorming many ideas, we settled on four promising solutions. In order to narrow down our
                    options to a final focus area we designed the following alternatives matrix.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Brainstorming Solutions</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">From the matrix above, the clustered planters and mobile watering bin
                    solution were our top two options. We started sketching solutions that would fall into either one or
                    both of the alternatives. We eventually decided on a concept similar to our final solution which
                    incorporated both of these alternatives.</p>

                    used materials provided by the Ford Design Center. We started with multiple foam core mockups before
                    deciding on the final design. Our final prototype was built of wood and measured 3'x3'x3.5'.

                <h2 class="subsection__title">The Design Process Matters</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">As a first introduction to design thinking, I learned about the complexities
                    of the design process. One problem in design can have many solutions, however the best solution
                    takes time, effort and research to achieve. Design isn’t just about sketching and choosing one
                    option to go with, but rather there is a methodical approach you can take to choose the best outcome
                    that will meet the user’s needs. To find this best outcome, research and testing are used to support
                    design decisions.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Design Has Influence</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">I’ve always been a believer in the fact that design has an impact on our
                    lives since we interact with design in so many different capacities every day. However, this class
                    helped me to realize the true extent of that statement. Not only does design simply make you enjoy
                    using one object over another thereby making your life more comfortable, but it also gives users the
                    opportunity to be able to participate in activities and accomplish tasks that they otherwise would
                    not be able to.</p>
