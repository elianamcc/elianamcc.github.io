                <p class="projectDescrip__body">I had an amazing experience working on this project throughout my senior
                    year. The project's goal was to design a high fidelity prototype for a need that users experience on
                    a regular basis. In our assigned team we had to determine a need we saw in the world on our own, but
                    we had to ensure our final prototype was designed for manufacturability and had a viable
                    commercialization strategy. Throughout this project, I broadened my team management skills,
                    completed extensive user research and gained engineering skills through technical testing. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Overview</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">For this class, our professors let each team have free reign to find any
                    problem that we could prove out. As a group, we wanted the problem we were going to tackle to be
                    something users experience on a regular basis. We determined that there was a white space in
                    preparing high quality coffee while having low involvement in the process.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Defining Our Problem Space</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">After deciding to pursue the coffee direction, we needed to further narrow
                    down and define what part of the coffee making process we were looking to solve or improve. To do
                    this I performed zoom interviews, created, disseminated, and analyzed qualtrics surveys, and
                    analyzed social media platforms to determine coffee trends. These led to the creation of a function
                    tree and user personas to help us better understand the scope of our problem. We used those to
                    brainstorm multiple mockups that addressed limiting heating water and ensuring consistency in the
                    final product for users.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">User Testing</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we had our concepts that we wanted to test we built mockups and
                    performed user testing in person. Even though we had to perform testing while socially distanced, we
                    were able to receive valuable feedback. An analysis of our results determined that the hot water
                    direction was the most promising and interesting to users. I took this information and performed a
                    thorough patent analysis, which involved looking at 29 relevant patents and going through their
                    documentation history in order to determine points of differentiation.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h2 class="subsection__title">Works-Like Prototype</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">We started out with creating a basic work-slike prototype to see if we could
                prove functionality. Multiple rounds of testing and mockups led us to our final prototype, which was
                able to meet all of our marginal requirements and some of our desired requirements.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">DFA + DFM Considerations</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">To envision what we wanted our final product to look like we took to Solidworks.
                I assisted in tolerancing the casing components to ensure manufacturability. In addition to ensuring
                tolerances were reasonable, we also met with our professors and manufacturers to discuss the feasibility
                of actual production. We were able to take their feedback, especially relating to the joins between
                components, and use that to reach our final design.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">Looks-Like Prototype</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">Due to COVID restrictions, we would not be able to get the necessary parts
                shipped in time to create a works-like looks-like prototype. However, we were able to 3D print the shell
                in order to see the scale and how the casing components would fit together and assemble.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h2 class="subsection__title">Direct to Consumer Route</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">To truly experience the full scope of bringing a product to market we created
                the following commercialization strategy. We determined that the best commercialization route for the
                Thermometrik would be to start on Kickstarter, expand to offerings on Shopify and Amazon and eventually
                sell directly to consumers through our own website. This was the best route due to the fact that common
                competitors in the market, such as Fellow, found success through a similar route. This would also allow
                for higher margins and allow us to have a direct line to consumers for insights, which was something
                that we highly valued and wanted to have at the forefront of our brand. Even though this route would be
                more logistically challenging than other options, we believed the promise and possibilities after
                examining our prospective business model canvas outweighed the potential downsides.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection__title">Marketing Plan</h2>
            <p class="subsection__body">Our strategy for marketing was focused heavily on social media marketing as it
                aligned with our plans to launch through Kickstarter. We also included SEO and site content because a
                large portion of our target audience are coffee drinkers that meticulously research the topic. We wanted
                our brand to evoke the following in relation to our products: Precision, High-End, Minimal, Convenient,
                Modern. This led me to design the following color palette to be reflected in all marketing materials of
                black, white and blue. The black and white emphasizes precision, minimalism, high-end, and modern
                sentiments, while the blue ties our focus back to water.</p>
