                <p class="project__descrip">is an assembly-based toy car designed as an occupational therapy (OT) task. We partnered with the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab to create the Construct-A-Car as an alternative task for OT patients with manual labor backgrounds to have a task that is more meaningful and engaging to them personally while in therapy. This project was created for Design Thinking and Communication, a 10-week engineering course at Northwestern University.</p>

                    <p class="mainText paddingLeft">We wanted to design a durable, engaging, and accessible occupational therapy tinkering task for Shirley Ryan AbilityLab patients with manual labor backgrounds. Our product was modifiable to different skill levels, usable regardless of technical background, and interesting to patients of different experiences. We also included an assembly procedure guide to allow therapists to easily and accurately assemble the product.</p>

As a team member, I participated in user research, prototype testing, created all final sketches and renderings of our design, modeled base frame components using NX software in order to laser cut pieces with Coreldraw, and machined components using the bandsaw.

                                The exterior frame allows users to work on their motor skills by twisting the screws to attach the frame pieces to the base frame. From user observation it was found that a twisting motion was natural to many patients, and user testing found that patients enjoyed attaching tasks and thought that working on those kinds of skills were valuable.

                                A motor was included because we wanted a way for the patient to be able to partake in the process of creating the required energy. We chose a wind up motor specifically due to the fact that the therapist would not have to have an additional cost of replacing batteries.

                                Through research and client interaction, we found that patients really enjoyed when they could see a tangible result from their actions. This is why we wanted to include a motor that patients could physically see move. Patients are able to interact with the parts in order to put it together.
