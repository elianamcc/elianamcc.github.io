                    interesting to patients of different experiences. We also included an assembly procedure guide to
                    allow therapists to easily and accurately assemble the product.</p>

                    research, prototype testing, created all final sketches and renderings of our design, modeled base
                    frame components using NX software in order to laser cut pieces with Coreldraw, and machined

                            The exterior frame allows users to work on their motor skills by twisting the screws to
                            attach the frame pieces to the base frame. From user observation it was found that a
                            twisting motion was natural to many patients, and user testing found that patients enjoyed
                            attaching tasks and thought that working on those kinds of skills were valuable.

                            A motor was included because we wanted a way for the patient to be able to partake in the
                            process of creating the required energy. We chose a wind up motor specifically due to the
                            fact that the therapist would not have to have an additional cost of replacing batteries.

                            Through research and client interaction, we found that patients really enjoyed when they
                            could see a tangible result from their actions. This is why we wanted to include a motor
                            that patients could physically see move. Patients are able to interact with the parts in
                            order to put it together.
