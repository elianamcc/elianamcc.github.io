                <p class="subsection__body">We started by interviewing users who were currently in occupational therapy
                    with our client to see what kinds of tasks they find enjoyable and what motions were very familiar
                    to them. From these observational interviews, we discovered that twisting motions like turning a
                    screw was very familiar to users. They also expressed that they enjoyed seeing the result of what
                    they had accomplished.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Creating an Assembly-Based Task</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Our research led us to believe that having a task that the users could
                    assemble and disassemble would meet the requirements of seeing the result of their hard work, while
                    also being something that the physical therapist could use again and again for multiple patients.
                    This introduced the challenge of creating something sturdy enough to stand up to the use and strain
                    of the user constantly assembling and disassembling our product.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Why Construct-A-Car?</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">After many brainstorming sessions, we settled on the form factor of a toy
                    car due to its small form factor, which would allow it to be easily used and stored in the current
                    physical therapy location. Additionally, cars are something familiar to this user base and most of
                    them would have some experience and knowledge of what the resulting product would look like. Also,
                    we could include a wind-up motor that would mean that the users would not only be able to see the
                    final physical representation of the car come together, but they would also be able to see the car
                    move and show that what they built truly worked.</p>

                            The exterior frame allows users to work on their motor skills by twisting the screws to
                            attach the frame pieces to the base frame. From user observation it was found that a
                            twisting motion was natural to many patients, and user testing found that patients enjoyed
                            attaching tasks and thought that working on those kinds of skills were valuable.

                            A motor was included because we wanted a way for the patient to be able to partake in the
                            process of creating the required energy. We chose a wind up motor specifically due to the
                            fact that the therapist would not have to have an additional cost of replacing batteries.

                            that patients could physically see move. Patients are able to interact with the parts in
                            order to put it together.

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Benefits of Adaptability</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">When we first started creating mockups we saw that our general concept
                    appeared sound. However, when we went to create our final prototype we found many difficulties in
                    manufacturing the Construct-A-Car with our basic shop knowledge. Seeing the inefficiencies and
                    inaccuracies in our production method I researched other manufacturing methods we could use and
                    found that laser cutting was suitable for our needs. After realizing this, I reached out to an older
                    student who worked in the shop and had her teach me how to use the laser cutter and its software.
                    Laser cutting turned out to be very effective for what we needed, and I learned the importance of
                    continually learning, how seeking out new methods can pay off and that it is beneficial to admit
                    mistakes for the sake of improvement.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Designing for Assembly</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">With design you are often focused on the end product or final result. In
                    this case, though, we wanted our final result to be one that wasn’t permanent, but instead was in an
                    intermediate stage that could be added to and then subtracted from. When building mockups or rough
                    prototypes, thinking on the fly and improvising can be helpful and often necessary in speeding up
                    the process and allowing for more efficient methods of production. While new discoveries and changes
                    weren’t absent in our building process, we had to start with a much more detailed and thought out
                    plan for how all of the final components would come together. Additionally, when considering how new
                    discoveries could benefit certain processes, such as securing parts together faster, we needed to
                    consider how that would affect the future disassembly of the Construct-A-Car. Overall, this led me
                    to think outside the box and learn to look at solutions from multiple perspectives to truly grasp an
                    understanding of how the decisions I make in the beginning can impact the product in the end.</p>
