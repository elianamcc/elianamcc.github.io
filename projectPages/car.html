                <p class="project__descrip">is a toy car designed for patients in occupational therapy (OT) at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab to assemble themselves as an OT task. The Construct-A-Car provides an alternative task for OT patients with manual labor backgrounds to have a task that is more meaningful and engaging than regular OT tasks. This project was created for Design Thinking and Communication, a 10-week engineering course at Northwestern University.</p>

The product should be modifiable to different levels, usable regardless of technical background, and interesting to patients of different experiences. An included assembly procedure guide should allow therapists to easily and accurately assemble the product.</p>

As a team member, I participated in user research, prototype testing, created all final sketches and renderings of our design, modeled base frame components using NX software in order to laser cut pieces with Coreldraw, and machined components using the bandsaw.

                                The exterior frame allows user to work on their motor skills by twisting the screws to attach the frame pieces to the base frame. From user observation it was found that a twisting motion was natural to many patients, and user testing found that patients enjoyed attaching tasks and thought that working on those kinds of skills were valuable.

                                Our research showed that a wind up motor would be useful so that the patient would be able to partake in the process of creating the required energy. Also, because it does not require batteries, this motor should last longer without needing replacement.

                                Through research and client interaction, we found that patients really enjoyed when they could see a tangible result from their actions. This is why we wanted to have them be able to see a motor that would physically move. Patients will be able to interact with the parts in order to put it together.
