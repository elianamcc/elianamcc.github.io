                    on meeting those user needs. Throughout the course, I practiced and developed observational methods,
                    brainstorming, rapid prototyping, user testing, business models, and the social, marketing, and

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Initial Research</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">To ensure our project was truly human-centered, each team member performed
                    in-person observations, interviews, and sent out surveys to gain insight into the many different
                    problems people of various ages and backgrounds encounter. After accumulating more than 100
                    perceived problems, we used three different elimination matrices with weighted criteria to narrow
                    down our problem spaces to our final two options.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Weighing Our Options</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Before we settled on addressing homelessness, one potential option was
                    improving the takeout experience, as all students needed to take out meals on campus due to COVID.
                    Takeout was a project that we would easily have access to users for, while homelessness would
                    present many more barriers to access users. However, the challenge that addressing homelessness
                    presented, along with the great possibility for social impact, seemed far more important to address
                    than looking at takeout solutions. While we knew that we would not be able to accomplish systematic
                    change in a quarter, we hoped to design a product that would provide comfort and allow users to
                    safely secure their belongings, which would promote independence. This would hopefully allow those
                    experiencing homelessness to be able to leave the cycle of homelessness more easily.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Defining the Problem</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">There are many different problems that those experiencing homelessness face,
                    so we first determined which aspects our prototype would prioritize. We found that people
                    experiencing homelessness struggle to find comfort and safely secure their belongings. We also saw a
                    whitespace in shelter solutions that were highly mobile and promoted independence for the user. This
                    led us to want to create a comfortable shelter solution that filled this white space, while also
                    offering some kind of secure storage solution.</p>

                <div class="flexBox">
                    <img class="fullImage"
                        src="https://portfolio-mccomas.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ShelterCase/ShelterWhitespace.jpg">
                </div>

                <p class="subsection__body">Using those criteria as guidelines, we brainstormed different solutions. The
                    most promising idea was my following sketch, which was a backpack that could be used for storage and
                    expand into a shelter. Many of those we interviewed used backpacks to transport their belongings and
                    the concept could meet all of the requirements we set.</p>

                <div class="flexBox">
                    <img class="fullImage"
                        src="https://portfolio-mccomas.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ShelterCase/ShelterSketch.jpg">
                </div>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Initial Concept Validation</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">To validate this idea, we used the sketch above and took to the streets to
                    ask people what they thought of our concept. While the feedback for the sentiment was positive in
                    that they believed we were focusing on the right things, everyone we interviewed mentioned the same
                    thing- that there would be a security issue. All interviewees said that they had had their
                    belongings stolen at one point, some even with backpacks that had “slash-proof” material. </p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Going Back to the Drawing Board</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">With this new information, we knew it was impractical to continue with the
                    backpack concept. However, we liked a lot of aspects of the original design and thought that the
                    accordion-style expanding motion provided many opportunities. We knew that we needed to have a
                    different base storage method. After a long design brainstorming session, we realized that a
                    suitcase would be a great solution due to its portability, large storage capacity, and ability to be
                    made from more durable materials to prevent theft. This was validated by the fact that a couple of
                    interviewees used suitcases as their chosen method of storage and transportation for their
                    belongings.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Designing ShelterCase</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we decided on the suitcase format, we needed to figure out how all
                    aspects of the ideas we had could be incorporated into the design. The main problem was how to
                    expand the suitcase into the bed. We started with bed slats that would come out from the interior of
                    the suitcase and could stretch out to form a platform. Elevating the bed into a platform was
                    something that would set our design apart from sleeping bags and tents as the additional space would
                    better protect against the weather. However, bed slats can be hard to manufacture, and so many
                    moving parts meant that it was hard to support and could be unwieldy for users to take out of the
                    box and manipulate. This led us to look at putting the bed slats outside of the suitcase, and
                    finally to our final design of having the platform be a solid tri-fold base, which was much easier
                    both to manufacture and for users to manipulate. This idea was validated through patent research
                    using Derwent Innovate.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Making ShelterCase</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we had this core concept, we turned to Solidworks to figure out the
                    details of the design. We brought the functional, detailed CAD model renderings to the Evanston
                    Hospitality Center to get feedback from users. Those at the shelter stated that they much preferred
                    the suitcase design over the backpack idea and that the locking mechanism along with the ability to
                    transform and be portable were the aspects they thought were most important.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Creating a Physical Prototype</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">After receiving positive feedback, we moved forward with creating our
                    physical prototype. While we ran into a couple of manufacturing issues, like not accounting for the
                    size of the hinge in how the trifold would operate and lay and how welding would warp the steel
                    legs, we could use the vast majority of our CAD design for exact measurements, directions and
                    placement due to our care and due diligence in the earlier stages of the design process.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Prototype Validation</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">After creating our prototype, we wanted to validate our concept with users,
                    as we wanted the ShelterCase to be a product that those experiencing homelessness would use. I
                    brought our physical prototype to the Evanston Hospitality Center. We were able to show our
                    prototype to both those experiencing homelessness and those who work at the shelter. The physical
                    prototype was slightly awkward, hard to maneuver, and not balanced well. Despite these and many
                    other flaws, we were able to communicate the main aspects of the project and showcase all the
                    desired functionality of our product. The feedback we received was extremely positive with one
                    potential user stating that he could see himself using our prototype now even with all of the
                    current flaws.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Confidence in Leadership</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">For this project, I was the only senior amongst a group of juniors. My
                    additional year plus the experience that I had and was concurrently getting in my capstone project
                    allowed me a greater amount of insight into the design process. As an outsider, I was initially
                    worried about dominating the project. However, when it came to going through the design process I
                    knew from previous experiences some new techniques could be very beneficial. As I introduced these
                    different techniques to the group, I was able to act as a mentor figure to my team members and help
                    guide them, and I gained confidence in my knowledge and leadership abilities.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Importance of Human-Centered Design</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Though all Northwestern projects follow the “human-centered design” process,
                    before this project I was simply going through the motions. The ease of the pandemic allowed us to
                    interact safely with users in person and I was able to see the importance this project had to users.
                    Previous projects were always for a client, so I could see the impact it made on them but never for
                    the actual end-user. Seeing those experiencing homelessness react to our product truly put into
                    perspective the significance of good design in user’s lives, and how meeting the true needs of the
                    user is the most important goal of all.</p>
