                <h2 class="subsection__title">Initial Research</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">To ensure our project was truly human-centered, each team member spent time
                    performing in-person observations, interviews, and sending out surveys to gain insight into the many
                    different problems people similar to our situation encounter, as well as problems that people in
                    other stages of life encounter. After accumulating more than 100 perceived problems, we used three
                    different elimination matrices with weighted criteria to narrow down our problem spaces to our final
                    two options.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Weighing Our Options</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">One option was improving the takeout experience, as all students needed to
                    take out meals on campus due to COVID, and our other was the option we decided to go with-
                    addressing homelessness. Takeout was a personal project that we would easily have access to users
                    for, while homelessness would present many more barriers with accessing users. However, the
                    challenge that addressing homelessness presented, along with the great possibility for social impact
                    excited us much more than looking at takeout solutions. Even though we knew this problem space would
                    present a large challenge, our passion for the project led us to believe that we would be able to
                    create a prototype that would meet the needs of those experiencing homelessness.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Defining the Problem</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">There are many different problems that those experiencing homelessness face,
                    so we first needed to determine which aspects were important for us to include in our prototype. We
                    determined that people experiencing homelessness struggle to find comfort and safely secure their
                    belongings. We also saw a whitespace in shelter solutions that were highly mobile and promoted
                    independence for the user. This led us to want to create a comfortable shelter solution that allowed
                    users to be mobile and independent, while also offering some kind of secure storage solution.</p>

                <div class="flexBox">
                    <img class="fullImage"
                        src="https://portfolio-mccomas.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Bionic+Wrench/Jaw+locator+assembly.JPG">
                </div>

                <p class="subsection__body">Using those criteria as guidelines, we started to brainstorm different
                    solutions. The most promising idea was my following sketch, which was a backpack that could be used
                    for storage and expand into a shelter. We thought this idea had great promise and many of those we
                    interviewed used backpacks to transport their belongings and the concept could meet all of the
                    requirements we set.</p>

                <div class="flexBox">
                    <img class="fullImage"

                </div>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Initial Concept Validation</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">To validate this idea, we used the sketch above and asked people what they
                    thought of our concept on the streets. While the feedback for the sentiment was positive in that
                    they believed we were focusing on the right things, everyone we interviewed mentioned the same
                    thing- that there would be a security issue. All interviewees said that they had had their backpacks
                    slashed and belongings stolen. One person stated that he had gotten his backpack slashed while using
                    his backpack as a pillow on the train. Others said that even when they had backpacks with
                    “slash-proof” material, they still had their bags cut and belongings stolen.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Going Back to the Drawing Board</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">With this new information, we knew it was impractical to continue with the
                    backpack concept. However, we liked a lot of aspects of the original design and thought that the
                    accordion-style expanding motion provided many opportunities. We knew that we needed to have a
                    different base storage method though. The result of a long design brainstorming session resulted in
                    us realizing that a suitcase would be a great solution due to its portability, large storage
                    capacity, ability to be made from more durable materials to prevent theft, and the fact that a
                    couple of interviewees actually used suitcases as their choice method of storage and transportation
                    for their belongings.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Designing ShelterCase</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we decided on the suitcase format, we needed to figure out how all
                    aspects of the ideas we had could be incorporated into the design. The main problem was how to
                    expand the suitcase into the bed. We started out with bed slats that would come out from the
                    interior of the suitcase and could stretch out to form a platform. We knew that elevating the bed
                    into a platform was something that would set us apart from sleeping bags and tents as the additional
                    space would protect against weather better. However, bed slats can be hard to manufacture, and so
                    many moving parts meant that it was hard to support and could be unwieldy for users to take out of
                    the box and manipulate. This led us to look at putting the bed slats outside of the suitcase, and
                    finally to our final design of having the platform be a solid trifold base, which was much easier
                    both to manufacture and for users to manipulate. This idea was validated through patent research
                    usign Derwent Innovate.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Making ShelterCase</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Once we had this core concept, we turned to Solidworks to figure out the
                    details of the design. Once we had a functional, detailed CAD model we brought renderings to the
                    Evanston Hospitality Center to get feedback from users about our concept. Those at the shelter
                    stated that they much preferred the suitcase design over the backpack idea, and that the locking
                    mechanism along with the ability to transform and be portable were the aspects they thought were
                    most important.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Creating a Physical Prototype</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">This gave us confidence in our design and allowed us to move forward with
                    creating our physical prototype. While we ran into a couple manufacturing issues, like not
                    accounting for the size of the hinge in how the trifold would operate and lay and how welding would
                    warp the steel legs, we could use the vast majority of our CAD design for exact measurements,
                    directions and placement due to our care and duediligence in the earlier stages of the design
                    process.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Prototype Validation</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">After creating our prototype, we wanted to validate our concept with users,
                    as we wanted the ShelterCase to be a product that those experiencing homelessness would use. I
                    brought our physical prototype, along with one other group member, to the Evanston Hospitality
                    Center. We were able to show our prototype to both those experiencing homelessness and those who
                    work at the shelter. The physical prototype was slightly awkward, hard to maneuver, and not balanced
                    well. Despite these and many other flaws, we were able to communicate the main aspects of the
                    project and showcase all the desired functionality of our product. The feedback we received was
                    extremely positive with one potential user stating that he could see himself using our prototype now
                    even with all of the current flaws.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subsection__title">Confidence in Leadership</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">For this project, I was the only senior amongst a group of juniors. My
                    additional year plus the experience that I had and was concurrently getting in my capstone
                    project allowed me a greater amount of insight into the design process. As an outsider, I was
                    initially worried that they would think I was dominating the project and think that because of
                    my additional knowledge that I was better than them. However, when it came to going through the
                    design process I knew from previous experiences some new techniques could be very beneficial. As
                    I introduced these different techniques to the group, I was able to act as a mentor figure to my
                    team members and help guide them, and I gained confidence in my knowledge and leadership
                    abilities.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection__title">Importance of Human-Centered Design</h2>
                <p class="subsection__body">Though all Northwestern projects follow the “human-centered design”
                    process, before this project I was simply going through the motions. The ease of the pandemic
                    allowed us to interact safely with users in person and I was able to see the importance this
                    project had to users. Previous projects were always for a client, so I could see the impact it
                    made on them but never for the actual end user. Seeing those experiencing homelessness react to
                    our product truly put into perspective the significance of good design in user’s lives, and how
                    meeting the true needs of the user is the most important goal of all.</p>
