                <span class="intro__info">
                    I recently graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelors of Science in Manufacturing and
                    Design Engineering along with a minor in Architectural Engineering and Design. My education focused
                    on design, product development, and manufacturing methods. With a basis in Industrial Design,
                    Mechanical Engineering, and Industrial Engineering, I am well versed in all aspects of the design
                    process, from Research and Development to Concept Generation to Manufacturing Methods.
                    <br>
                    <br>My time at Northwestern helped me become a designer who considers technical realities when
                    iterating and an engineer who focuses on keeping the user at the core of my work. These skills help
                    me to determine the root cause of problems and close the gaps that form when solving
                    cross-disciplinary problems.
                    <br>
                    <br>When I'm not working I enjoy contemporary dance, making art, taking photos and exploring other
                    ways to be creative. See the creative adventures section if want to see some of my selected work!
